    "### Polymorphism\n",
    "\n",
    "- An important principle in OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)\n",
    "- Polymorphism means having multiple forms or faces\n",
    "- There are three main concepts in polymorphism:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Method Overriding**\n",
    "    - Occurs when a child class has a method with the same name as a method in its parent class\n",
    "    - The child class's method is executed, overriding the parent class's method\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Method Overloading**\n",
    "    - Refers to having multiple methods with the same name but different parameters within a single class\n",
    "    - Python does not support traditional method overloading as seen in other languages like Java\n",
    "    - Instead, Python uses default arguments to achieve similar functionality\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Operator Overloading**\n",
    "    - The same operator can have different behaviors based on the types of operands\n",
    "    - Example with the `+` operator:\n",
    "        - When used with strings, e.g., `\"hello\" + \"world\"`, it performs concatenation: `\"helloworld\"`\n",
    "        - When used with integers, e.g., `4 + 5`, it performs addition: `9`\n",
    "        - When used with lists, e.g., `[1, 2, 3] + [4, 5]`, it performs merging: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`\n",
    "    - In the context of user-defined classes, operator overloading allows custom behavior for operators\n",
    "    - For example, in a `Fraction` class, the `+` operator might be overloaded to handle fraction addition using the `__add__` magic method\n"

    "### Method Overloading in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "- The purpose of method overloading is to keep your code cleaner and more organized\n",
    "    - For example, instead of writing separate methods like `area_circle` and `area_rectangle`, you can have a single method that handles both cases\n",
    "- In languages like Java, method overloading allows multiple methods with the same name but different parameters\n",
    "- However, Python does not support traditional method overloading in the same way\n",
    "    - Python does not differentiate between methods based on their parameters\n",
    "- Instead, Python provides a technique to achieve similar functionality using default arguments\n",
    "    - By defining default values for parameters, you can create a single method that handles different cases based on the number of arguments provided\n",
