    "### Abstraction\n",
    "- It means hidden.\n",
    "- Example: Consider a laptop. Inside a laptop, there are many technicalities and circuits, but we do not care about them; we should just know how to run a laptop at a surface level.\n",
    "- The laptop is abstracted; the implementation details are hidden.\n",
    "- Another example from nature: Electromagnetic waves are not visible, but using them, we can perform many tasks like talking on the phone or using the internet.\n",
    "- We will understand how abstraction is implemented in software through an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Bank Application\n",
    "- Consider a scenario where we need to build a bank application.\n",
    "- At the top of the hierarchy, we have the main application connected to the database.\n",
    "- Below this, we have two more applications/classes: one is a web app and the other is a mobile app.\n",
    "- If the web app or mobile app wants to interact with data, it will take help from the bank app.\n",
    "- This demonstrates inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Now, suppose a senior developer is creating the bank app class. They want to enforce a constraint on the junior programmers developing the web app and mobile app.\n",
    "- The constraint is that if they want to inherit the bank app class, they must implement a security function, ensuring that both the mobile app and web app are secure.\n",
    "- Thus, the concept of abstraction allows a senior developer to impose constraints on junior programmers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We will understand this through code.\n"
